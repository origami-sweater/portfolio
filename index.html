        <h2 id="intro">Hello!</h2>
        <p>I'm a Thinkful student currently working as a supervisor for TotalMed- a travel nursing company. I'm based out of Appleton, WI.</p>

      <!-- Inserted article in a divider for aesthetic purposes.-->
         <p>As a student at Thinkful, I am eager to start a new career in web development. I find working with code to be engaging and incredibly rewarding. 
            Currently I have experience with JavaScript, HTML & CSS. It is a personal dream of mine to build my own visual novel using the skills I have learned in the Thinkful program.</p>
         <p>Web development also offers so many opportunities to collaborate with others. I love getting to know people and the joy that comes with executing projects as a team. 
            At my current job, I work with 9 different teams, 2 of which report to me directly. Drawing on the experiences of others and building those relationships is so exciting and important, whichever field you are in.
          </p>
          <p>The top 3 assets I bring to my teams are:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Patience</li>
            <li>Critical thinking</li>
            <li>Lighthearted attitude</li>
          </ol>
          <p>When I'm not studying web development or working, I spend a lot of time on my other interests. These include: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sketching</li> 
            <li>Hiking</li> 
            <li>Origami</li>
             <li>Playing Video Games</li>
          </ul>
